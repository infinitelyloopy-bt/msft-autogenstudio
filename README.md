- How to use GitHub for collaboration (even if you've never coded!)
- How to find answers and keep learning using free resources like YouTube and Copilot

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### 1. Install Visual Studio Code

AutoGen Studio works best with a good code editor for managing your agent files and configurations.

- Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Install with default settings
- Launch VS Code to verify installation

💡 **Why VS Code?** It provides excellent support for managing AutoGen Studio agent files, has built-in GitHub integration, and works seamlessly with GitHub Copilot for enhanced productivity.

### 2. Install Python (Windows & Mac)

AutoGen Studio requires Python (version 3.8–3.12). Installing version 3.12 is ideal.

- Go to [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
- Download and install a compatible version (check "Add Python to PATH" during setup for Windows)
- To verify: Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:
  - **Windows**: `python --version`
  - **Mac**: `python3 --version`
- You should see a version between 3.8 and 3.12.

⚠️ **Important**: AutoGen Studio v0.1.5 does not support Python 3.13 or newer.  
📖 See [Getting Started Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Getting-Started).

### 3. Install pip

Check if pip is installed by running:
- **Windows**: `pip --version`
- **Mac**: `pip3 --version`

If it's not found, follow the [pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### 4. Install AutoGen Studio

Once Python and pip are ready, run:
- **Windows**: `pip install autogenstudio==0.1.5`
- **Mac**: `pip3 install autogenstudio==0.1.5`

📚 More details here: [AutoGen Studio Docs](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Getting-Started)

### 5. Install OpenAI Python Library

- **Windows**: `pip install openai`
- **Mac**: `pip3 install openai`
