# Autogen Studio Agents for Microsoft DEMO

> This repository provides a comprehensive library of multi-agent systems and reusable agent definitions for [Autogen Studio](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Getting-Started), with a focus on Microsoft Data & AI and writing assistance. All agents follow a standardized template and orchestration model for clarity, collaboration, and production-readiness.


## Repository Structure

- **Microsoft_Data_AI_Agents/**  
  Agents for Data & AI scenarios, including presales, specialist, planner, customer, reviewer, researcher, group chat manager, and security reviewer roles. See `Microsoft_Data_AI_Agents/README.md` for details.

- **Writing_Assistant_Agents/**  
  A set of 5 specialized agents for reviewing and optimizing written content (blog posts, articles, papers):
  - Orchestrator: Coordinates the review process and synthesizes all feedback.
  - Content Editor: Improves structure, flow, and clarity.
  - Grammar & Style Specialist: Ensures language is correct and consistent.
  - Technical Reviewer: Checks for accuracy and credibility.
  - Audience Optimizer: Ensures content is relevant and engaging for the target audience.
  See `Writing_Assistant_Agents/README.md` for an overview.

- **Examples/**  
  Example user prompts and usage scenarios. See `Examples/User Prompts.md` for up-to-date prompt examples for all agent systems.

- **.github/copilot-instructions.md**  
  The authoritative guide for contributors and AI assistants, detailing agent design standards, templates, naming conventions, and orchestration best practices. **All agent definitions must follow the Markdown template and orchestration guidance in this file.**
## Agent Design & Standards

All agents are defined in Markdown files using a consistent template and naming convention, as described in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. This ensures:

- Clarity and reusability of agent definitions
- Explicit orchestration and multi-agent collaboration
- Easy extension and maintenance

**Key points:**

- Each agent is defined in its own Markdown file and grouped by domain or function in dedicated folders.
- Orchestrator, planner, and group chat manager agents are included for multi-agent coordination.
- System messages for each agent specify their role, expertise, and collaboration requirements.
- **All new agents must follow the Markdown template and orchestration rules in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.**
## Usage

1. Review agent definitions in the relevant folder for your scenario (Data & AI, Writing Assistance).
2. Use the provided templates and orchestration patterns to build your own multi-agent workflows in Autogen Studio.
3. Reference `Examples/User Prompts.md` for sample prompts and usage patterns for all agent systems.
4. Follow the standards in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for any new agent or system contributions.

# Welcome to the AutoGen Studio Workshop! üöÄ

**Empowering Everyone at Microsoft Asia to Explore AI ‚Äì No Coding Required!**

This workshop is designed for non-technical team members who want to confidently use AI tools like AutoGen Studio. You don't need a coding background or technical expertise ‚Äì just curiosity and a willingness to learn!

## üåü Workshop Overview

**What**: Hands-on introduction to AutoGen Studio (v0.1.5)  
**Who**: Non-technical Super Heroes  
**How**: Interactive Teams sessions (check your invites for details)  
**Why**: To build confidence, learn to follow technical instructions, and discover new ways to work smarter with AI for personal and professional development

## üìù What You'll Learn

- How to set up and use AutoGen Studio (v0.1.5) on your own computer
- How to use GitHub for collaboration (even if you've never coded!)
- How to find answers and keep learning using free resources like YouTube and Copilot

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### 1. Install Visual Studio Code

AutoGen Studio works best with a good code editor for managing your agent files and configurations.

- Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Install with default settings
- Launch VS Code to verify installation

üí° **Why VS Code?** It provides excellent support for managing AutoGen Studio agent files, has built-in GitHub integration, and works seamlessly with GitHub Copilot for enhanced productivity.

### 2. Install Python (Windows & Mac)

AutoGen Studio requires Python (version 3.8‚Äì3.12). Installing version 3.12 is ideal.

- Go to [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
- Download and install a compatible version (check "Add Python to PATH" during setup for Windows)
- To verify installation:
  
  **Windows users:**
  1. Press `Windows key + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter to open Command Prompt
  2. Type `python --version` and press Enter
  
  **Mac users:**
  1. Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, and press Enter to open Terminal
  2. Type `python3 --version` and press Enter

- You should see a version between 3.8 and 3.12.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: AutoGen Studio v0.1.5 does not support Python 3.13 or newer.  
üìñ See [Getting Started Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/Getting-Started).

2. Type `pip3 --version` and press Enter

If it's not found, follow the [pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### 4. Install AutoGen Studio

Once Python and pip are ready:

**Windows users:**
1. Open Command Prompt (press `Windows key + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter)
