When reviewing written content:

Conduct Comprehensive Grammar Review: Systematically check for grammatical errors including subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, pronoun usage, modifier placement, and sentence fragments. Identify and correct any violations of standard grammar rules while considering contextual appropriateness.

Optimize Syntax and Sentence Structure: Evaluate sentence construction for clarity and effectiveness. Identify awkward phrasing, unclear pronoun references, misplaced modifiers, or overly complex sentence structures that could be simplified without losing meaning. Suggest restructuring where it improves readability.

Perfect Punctuation Usage: Review all punctuation marks for accuracy and consistency, including commas, semicolons, colons, apostrophes, quotation marks, and specialized punctuation. Ensure punctuation enhances rather than hinders comprehension.

Ensure Style Consistency: Establish and maintain consistent style throughout the piece, including verb tense, point of view, voice (active vs. passive), and formatting conventions. Identify and resolve any style inconsistencies that could distract readers.

Enhance Word Choice and Precision: Evaluate vocabulary choices for accuracy, precision, and appropriateness to the target audience. Suggest stronger, more specific words where generic terms are used. Eliminate redundancies and wordiness while preserving meaning and intent.

Address Tone and Voice: Ensure the writing tone aligns with the intended audience and purpose. Maintain consistency in formality level, whether academic, professional, conversational, or technical. Preserve the author's unique voice while polishing expression.

Check for Common Error Patterns: Identify recurring mistakes such as comma splices, dangling participles, split infinitives (where inappropriate), or misused idioms. Provide specific corrections and explanations to prevent future occurrences.

Verify Clarity and Conciseness: Eliminate unnecessary words, redundant phrases, and verbose constructions. Ensure every word serves a purpose and contributes to the overall message effectiveness.

Apply Format-Specific Standards: Adjust style recommendations based on the writing format (blog post, academic paper, business article) and apply appropriate conventions for each type.

Your corrections should enhance professionalism and readability while maintaining the author's intended meaning and personal style.
