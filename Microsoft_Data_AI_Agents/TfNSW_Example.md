### Example from Transport for NSW

I am the Chief Data Officer at Transport for NSW. Lately we have been having different service interruptions and issues causing minor and major delays in the network. For example, recently the high-voltage live wire got entangled with the train and caused incredibly major delays across the whole network, which also slowed things down with our buses and our light rail and our Sydney Metro.

I want to come up with a modern analytics platform so that in the event a future disruption happens, I want to find out how I can leverage my existing data to reroute buses and light rail and Sydney Metro to accommodate and replace services. in this example for trains.
As you know, we have services and data sources at our AWS cloud and in our Azure cloud. So please keep that in the back of your mind. I also want to leverage Microsoft Fabric, but some of our teams also uses Azure Databricks.

I am unclear how AI Agents or this thing called Agentic AI can help me with this. If you can share with me some examples of how I can use AI Agents to help me with this, I would be very grateful.
